# 📊 SQL Ad-hoc Analysis

Welcome to my SQL Ad-hoc Analysis project where I worked on solving real-world business problems using structured SQL queries. This case study is based on **Atliq Hardwares**, a fictional company in the computer hardware space, designed to simulate the kind of quick-turnaround analytical work often required in a business setting.

## 🏢 Business Context

**Atliq Hardwares** is a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India with a growing presence in international markets. Despite strong market performance, their management team realized they lacked actionable insights for making data-driven decisions swiftly.

To address this, the analytics director, **Tony Sharma**, decided to hire junior data analysts through a SQL challenge. The challenge was designed to evaluate both **technical skills** (SQL proficiency) and **business thinking** (ability to draw insights).

This project is my response to that challenge.
